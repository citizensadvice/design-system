# PR template for Design System

These steps are designed to show what to do. After doing each step, delete all the placeholder lines
1) Rename title of PR to: feature/bugfix/refactor: TITLE OF PR [NP-XXX]
2) Add initial Reasons for Change: If you feel it easier to describe the change with code blocks feel free
3) Then add a bullet point for each "thing" you've changed with a brief explanation i.e.

- Refactored code in `directory/file.js`
  - This code was previously very messy
  - Now you can call this code all over the suite
- Opted to refactor constant `otherThing`
  - This should now allow users to write less code in css files
  
4a) If the PR is ready for review, assign the reviewers to it once the build has passed
4b) If the PR is not ready for review, do not assign any reviewers and attach a "do not merge" label
