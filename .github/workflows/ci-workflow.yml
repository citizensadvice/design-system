##
# This workflow runs two main groups of jobs:
#
# 1. A set of parallel jobs to run node and ruby based tests,
#    alongside a job to build the storybook docs and static assets.
#
# 2. A subsequent set of parallel jobs for backstop, and selenium.
#    These depend on the build job and are seeded with a copy of the docs.

  # Actions can run in parallel at the job or the workflow level.
  # In order to run our build-dependent tests in parallel we need a way
  # to build the docs and then "seed" each stage with a copy.
  # We can do this using using artifacts along with a `needs` clause on each job
