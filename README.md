## Build & contributing

For any dev related information, including contributing and building locally see the [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Using the library

The distributed package includes both the compiled CSS in `dist/lib.css` and the SCSS under `scss`. If you only need the CSS and do not intend to build custom components and layouts using the SCSS variables and mixins then just add `lib.css` to the `<HEAD>` of your page.

If you need the variables and mixins then import the top level SCSS file `scss/lib.scss`. Do **not** import individual files as you will very quickly run into dependency problems. The [styleguide](https://citizensadvice.github.io/design-system-testing/) documents that available classes, vars, mixins and functions available.
