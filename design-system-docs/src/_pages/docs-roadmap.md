This is an alpha release of the new design system documentation website that was released in October 2022.

It was migrated from the previous Storybook documentation and now uses the design system directly. The documentation itself is otherwise the same as the previous version of the website.

For future iterations we are working on:

- Revised component documentation
- Dedicated accessibility guidance
- Expanded getting started guides
- More detailed technical documentation
