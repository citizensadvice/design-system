Making content as easy to understand as possible makes it better for everybody.

We’re here to give people the knowledge and confidence they need to find their way forward - whoever they are, whatever their problem.

So we write for everyone and we help them take action.

## Writing content

The Citizens Advice style guide covers a lot of points that apply to accessibility, like:

- bullet points
- challenging every word
- headings and page titles
- structured headings

You can [read the Citizens Advice style guide](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/intranet/national/pages/writing-advice-content/) to understand how we write content for accessibility requirements.

## Captions

If you use video content, make sure it’s accessible to everyone. Not all users will have access to audio. Include captions and transcripts so users watching without audio can read all the content.

## Embedded content

Think carefully about how you’re using embedded content. In the CMS, we have lots of content you can embed, like:

- banners
- contact details
- monetary amounts
- tables

The most important content types to bear in mind when thinking about accessibility are:

- callouts
- targeted content

### Callouts

Before using a callout, make sure you need it. Fewer callouts have more of an impact on a piece of content. Too many callouts can confuse and distract users from other important content on a page.

Each new callout you use will need a new heading level. Think about where it’s placed within the heading structure of the page. The more heading levels there are, the harder it is to understand.

### Targeted content

You’ll need to think about the same things with targeted content. Targeted content has a bigger impact on accessibility because they’re interactive elements. An interactive element means a user must do something, like click a button, to read the content.

Because they’re interactive elements, you can’t embed targeted content within targeted content. This is to make sure accessibility isn’t impacted.

## Error messages

Describe what has happened and tell the user how to fix it. We use error messages in decision trees and template letters.

Avoid vague error messages like:

- ‘An error occurred’
- ‘Select an option’
- ‘Fill in the field’

A more helpful error message will tell them what’s wrong, like:

- ‘Enter your first name’
- ‘Select if you are British, Irish or a citizen of a different country’

## Images

To make images accessible, use 'alt text' in the CMS. Keep it brief yet descriptive. Be concise and accurately describe the image's context. Don’t start alt text with 'image of' because this will already be understood.

We don’t usually have images in advice content - these are more common in the [corporate section of the site](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/about-us/). Only use an image in advice content if you need to show the user what something looks like - for example, [energy meter readings](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/energy/energy-supply/your-energy-meter/how-to-read-your-energy-meter/).

### Decorative images

If your image doesn’t have any information in it, it’s a decorative image. Decorative images shouldn’t have any alt text - leave this field blank in the CMS.
