title: Using with Rails
order: 2
---

This guide walks through the process of using the Design System components in a [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) application.

This is the web application framework we use for the majority of our products at Citizens Advice.

The goal of this guide is to set up a basic Rails application from scratch using the design system. Along the way we'll describe any best practices or considerations you might need to make.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes you have some existing Rails knowledge. It also assumes you have the following dependencies installed:

- Ruby version 3.2 or later
- Node version 18 or later

## Creating the application

We'll start by creating a new Rails application. We're going to be creating an application with a few constraints:

- No database. We'll disable ActiveRecord to keep our guide simple.
- Use ERB for templates. Some of products use Haml but for this guide we'll use standard ERB templates.
- Use Sass for stylesheets using [cssbundling-rails](https://github.com/rails/cssbundling-rails). Sass is the recommend way to use the design system stylesheets.
- Use esbuild for JavaScript bundling using [jsbundling-rails](https://github.com/rails/jsbundling-rails)
- No Hotwire. Whilst you may want to explore this in your own applications we're skipping it for the purposes of this guide.

The following command will generate a new application with the presets described above:

```sh
rails new --skip-active-record --skip-hotwire --javascript=esbuild --css=sass design-system-guide
```

You can then run the application using the included dev script:

```sh
./bin/dev
```

## Loading the Design System engine

The `citizens_advice_components` gem is designed to provide deep integration of Design System components into your Rails application. It can be installed by adding the following to your `Gemfile`:

```
# Use the Citizens Advice Design System
# Pin to the same version as the npm package
gem "citizens_advice_components",
    github: "citizensadvice/design-system",
    tag: "v<%= CitizensAdviceComponents::VERSION %>",
    glob: "engine/*.gemspec"

# This line is optional. The citizens_advice_components gem is built
# on top of view_component and bundles this as a dependency but it
# is encouraged that you also use this for writing your own application
# components so it can be helpful to explicitly name this as a dependency.
gem "view_component"
```

Followed by:

```sh
bundle install
```

## Add a sample controller and view

Before we add any design system specific code we'll also need a basic controller and view to use.

We'll first generate a basic home controller using:

```sh
./bin/rails g controller home index --no-helper --skip-routes
```

Then, replace the contents of `app/views/home/index.html.erb` with:

```erb
<h1>Hello Design System!</h1>
```

And finally add the following to `config/routes.rb`:

```rb
root "home#index", as: :home
```

At this point running the application should look like this:

<img src="/images/guides/using-with-rails-01.png" alt="A Rails application showing Hello Design System!"/>

## Using the Design System assets

The actual styles and assets for the Design System come from `@citizensadvice/design-system`. You can install the core package from npm.

We'll make sure to pin to an exact version. The npm package and the gem versions need to match so it's important to specify an exact version here.

```sh
npm install --save-exact @citizensadvice/design-system@<%= CitizensAdviceComponents::VERSION %>
```

And finally, add the following to your `app/assets/stylesheets/application.sass.scss` entrypoint:

```scss
@import '@citizensadvice/design-system/scss/rails.scss';
```

The Rails engine bundles the fonts directly and adds them to the asset pipeline for you. The `rails.scss` entrypoint configures the `$cads-font-path` to resolve the fonts correctly. This is the equivalent to the following:

```scss
// Configure the font-path for use with the Rails engine
// which bundles a copy of the fonts to allow them to be auto loaded.
$cads-font-path: './citizens_advice_components';

@import '@citizensadvice/design-system/scss/lib.scss';
```

If this has worked you should be able to restart your application and see the words "Hello Design System!" using the Citizens Advice brand font (Open Sans).

## Setting up an application controller and layout

The basic template generated by our `rails new` command gave us enough to get going but in order to use all the design system components we'll need to add a few things to our `application_controller.rb` controller and `application.html.erb` layout.

To our `ApplicationController` we need to add the design system helpers, this makes shared view helpers available to our application.

```rb
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  include CitizensAdviceComponents::Helpers
end
```

To our `application.html.erb` layout we'll need to add the following:

```erb
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html class="no-js" lang="<%%= I18n.locale %>">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Design System guide</title>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1">
    <%%= cads_meta_preload_fonts %>
    <%%= csrf_meta_tags %>
    <%%= csp_meta_tag %>
    <%%= stylesheet_link_tag "application", media: "all" %>
    <script>document.querySelector('html').classList.remove('no-js');</script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <%%# This ID is required when using the skip links provided by the header component %>
    <div id="cads-main-content"><%%= yield %></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

Once you've done this we can also update our sample view at `app/views/home/index.html.erb` to include some layout classes.

```erb
<div class="cads-page-content">
  <div class="cads-grid-container">
    <div class="cads-grid-row">
      <main class="cads-grid-col-md-8">
        <h1 class="cads-page-title">Hello Design System!</h1>
      </main>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

At this point you should have something like this:

<img src="/images/guides/using-with-rails-03.png" alt="A Rails application showing Hello Design System! with a basic application layout"/>

## Using components

The design system Rails engine bundles a set a set of [ViewComponents](https://viewcomponent.org/) for all of the major components in the design system. Try adding the following to your home page view:

```erb
<div class="cads-prose">
  <p>Thanks for following along with the design system guide</p>
  <h2>Example components<h2>
  <p>A callout is included below for reference, try rendering a few other components yourself.</p>
</div>

<%%= render CitizensAdviceComponents::Callout.new(type: :standard) do %>
  <p>This is an example callout</p>
<%% end %>
```

If everything has worked as expected you should see a callout component rendered on the page.

## Adding your own components

The Design System components are built on top of [ViewComponent](https://viewcomponent.org/). It is recommend that you use this library to build your own application components too. In fact let's use it to customise the [header component](/components/header) and [navigation component](/components/navigation) to suit our application.

Start by creating an `app/components` directory:

```sh
mkdir -p app/components
```

Add a new file at `app/components/app_header_component.rb` with the following contents:

```rb
class AppHeaderComponent < ViewComponent::Base
  def navigation_links
    [
      { url: "#", title: "Benefits" },
      { url: "#", title: "Work" },
      { url: "#", title: "Debt and money" },
      { url: "#", title: "Consumer" },
      { url: "#", title: "Housing" },
      { url: "#", title: "Family" },
      { url: "#", title: "Law and courts" },
      { url: "#", title: "Immigration" },
      { url: "#", title: "Health" }
    ]
  end
end
```

And a corresponding template file at `app/components/app_header_component.html.erb` with the following contents:

```erb
<%%= render CitizensAdviceComponents::Header.new do |c| %>
  <%% c.with_logo(title: "Citizens Advice homepage", url: "/") %>
  <%% c.with_search_form(search_action_url: "/search") %>
<%% end %>
<%%= render CitizensAdviceComponents::Navigation.new(links: navigation_links) %>
```

You can view the [ViewComponent guides](https://viewcomponent.org/) for more information on how this library works but essentially this defines a custom component which _wraps_ the Design System header component and configures it to suit our application.

After restarting the application you can then add the following to your `application.html.erb` layout:

```erb
<%%= render AppHeaderComponent.new %>
```

If everything has worked you should see the Citizens Advice logo, a search form, and the navigation.

Let's repeat the process to add a global footer.

Add a new file at `app/components/app_footer_component.rb` with the following contents:

```rb
class AppFooterComponent < ViewComponent::Base
  def call
    render CitizensAdviceComponents::Footer.new do |c|
      c.with_feedback_link(url: "https://example.com/")
    end
  end
end
```

Here we're using ViewComponents ability to render without a template file, by defining a `call` method.

Just like the header component we can then call this from our `application.html.erb` layout using:

```erb
<%%= render AppFooterComponent.new %>
```

After you've done this you should have a page that looks something like this:

<img src="/images/guides/using-with-rails-05.png" alt="A Rails application using the design system header and footer"/>

## Using JavaScript components

Up until this point we've not loaded _any_ JavaScript. This is because the Design System is built on the principles of progressive enhancement and doesn't need JavaScript to function.

However some components have some companion JavaScript behaviour. In our case the header and navigation components have some extra JavaScript we need to load for the best experience.

Add the following to your `app/javascript/application.js` entrypoint:

```
import { initHeader, initGreedyNav } from '@citizensadvice/design-system';

initHeader();
initGreedyNav();
```

Each of the [component guides](/components) tell you if the require any additional JavaScript along with any polyfills they might require for older browsers.

If everything has worked as expected you should be able to resize your browser window and see some additional behaviour in the header and navigation.

## Recap

If you made it this far you should have a brand new Rails application and have seen how to:

- Install and configure the Design System for use with Rails
- Set up the basic layout structure the Design System requires.
- Use ViewComponent to write your own components which wrap Design System components
- Have a sample template you can try out for yourself or use as a basis for your own application.

## Next Steps

- Have a go using the application you've just created and try rendering a few more Design System components after reading the [component guides](/components/).
- Read the [ViewComponent guides](https://viewcomponent.org/). Although it's possible to use the Rails components without understanding everything about how ViewComponent works it's worth getting a feel for it as well as understanding how you can use it for your own application code.
- Look at the source code for the [demo application](https://github.com/citizensadvice/design-system/tree/main/demo). This is a reference implementation of the Design System in Rails and is used for all our integration tests so has lots of examples.

Thanks for following along!
