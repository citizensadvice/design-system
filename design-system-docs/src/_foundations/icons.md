Icons should be informative and recognisable. They should only be used in a purposeful manner to maximise comprehension when you need to call attention to a particular action. Icons should be used in combination with a meaningful label or supporting text whenever possible. Avoid aria-labels if you are rendering the icon with visible text to prevent accessibility label duplication.
