title: Using icons
order: 1
---

If you are implementing SVG icons in your code, please refer to [Components - SVG Icons](?path=/docs/components-svg-icons--default).

Icons should be informative and recognisable. They should only be used in a purposeful manner to maximise comprehension when you need to call attention to a particular action.
Icons should be used in combination with a meaningful label or supporting text whenever possible. Avoid `aria-labels` if you are rendering the icon with visible text to prevent accessibility label duplication.

## Colour

Icons should always be in a single, solid colour and need to meet the same colour contrast ratio as Typography (4.5:1). The colour of the icon should reflect the importance of the icon‚Äôs action which should always be to help guide a user. For more information on colour, see the [Colour guidelines](/design-system/?path=/story/foundations-colours--page).

## Sizing

There are 2 icon sizes in our Design System:

### 16px (small)

We use small icons in our components such as "Chevron" in the buttons or a "Plus" in the targeted content. We also use an "External link" in the content whenever it‚Äôs needed.

### 24px (medium)

Medium icons are generally used as a button such as the "Search" button and the "Print this page" button in the toolbar on the Public site and AdviserNet.
Do not attempt to re-size the icon, as they are designed specifically for a certain size. Only use these 2 icon sizes to ensure the consistency throughout our designs.

<%= render(Shared::IconGrid.new) %>

## Alignment

When an icon is right next to the text, they should be centre-aligned and have 4px spacing in-between.

### Considerations before creating a new icon

Before trying to create a new icon:

- propose the new icons to the design community and discuss details and requirements in the regular design system meeting or design community meeting
- consider if the new icon serves an user need ‚Äì if you‚Äôre not sure, you probably don‚Äôt need it
- check if the new icon will be used multiple times throughout different products or services
- make sure the new icon has a clear meaning

Propose the new icons to the design community and discuss details and requirements in the regular design system meeting or design community meeting. This will help us to have a transparent process for creating new assets, maintaining a minimal and high quality icon set in our Design System.

### Clarity (pixel-perfect)

In order to have the best clarity especially for lower resolution screens, make sure the icon is always pixel-perfect.

üëç Do: an icon is on pixel and pixel-perfect.

üëé Don't: an icon is off pixel.

### Making an icon

Use the guideline artboards in the [Design System 2.0 Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/J9qfbS9n1pUM2dpRQnTXUD/?node-id=716%3A0) and follow the rules below. Speak to the design community if you have any questions about the rules.

- Use the 16px x 16px or 24px x 24px artboard for each icon.
- The 16px icon should have 1px padding and the 24px icon should have 2px padding.
- Set your workspace up from the start to snap to pixels without decimals.
- Icons should be at whole pixels. No decimals are allowed in x and y coordinates or width and height fields.
- Each artboard and the artwork within it must be aligned to the pixel grid.
- The icon should be on the top of the boundary box layer in the artboard.
- All possible shapes and paths should be combined. This will allow us to have a good SVG setup when extracting icons.
