## Introduction to keyboard focus styling

Keyboard focus styling is an indicator to users where they are on a page and which item has keyboard focus so users know what they’re interacting with. Keyboard focus has different variations depending on the component. Focus styling must be clear and visible to the user.

Here are some examples of how we approach keyboard focus styling at Citizens Advice. We use the Focus colour (#FFD250) to highlight focus areas.

## Why it’s important

Keyboard styling offers clarity to a user and helps them in navigation on a page's content. Bad keyboard focus styling can make users feel lost in a web page and not know how to move forward with their interactions with us. We want users to be able to interact with our products and digital services and have clarity on where they’re going to move to next.
