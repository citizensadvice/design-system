## What is alt-text and why is it important?

Alternative text serves as a textual description of images, graphics, and other non-textual elements within a web page or digital product. The importance of alt text lies in its ability to provide access, context, and inclusivity, making online experiences more meaningful and accessible to a broader range of users.

Alt text is primarily designed to ensure that individuals with visual impairments or those who use screen readers can access and understand the content within images. By describing these visual elements in text form, it allows all our users to experience our products in the same way.

Alt text helps all users understand the context and purpose of images, including those with slow internet connections or who choose to disable image loading. It ensures that no one misses out on vital information conveyed through visuals.

Alt text also plays a significant role in improving the discoverability of web content through search engines. It will also display if the image does not load or there is a slow connection.

## Key points when writing alt-text

When writing alt text (alternative text), it's important to consider several key things to ensure that your content is accessible to individuals with disabilities, particularly those who use screen readers.

- Describe the content: The primary purpose of alt text is to describe the content and function of the image. Be concise and focus on the most important information. Consider what the image conveys and what a person would miss if they couldn't see it. Screen readers already announce that an element is an image, so you can start with the description itself.
- Be specific: Provide enough detail to convey the essential information. If the image contains text, include that text in the alt text. If the image is a photograph of a person, include their name and relevant details .A good rule of thumb is to aim for 125 characters or less.
- Context: Consider the context in which the image appears. Sometimes, an image's meaning can change depending on the surrounding content. Tailor your alt text accordingly to make sense in context. Ensure that your alt text is inclusive and respectful of diversity.
- Avoid redundant text: If the image's purpose is already described in nearby text, you can use shorter alt text or leave it empty (alt=""). However, if the image adds additional context or information, it may still require alt text.
- Decorative images: If an image is purely decorative and doesn't convey meaningful content or function, it's best to provide empty alt text (alt="") or use the "role" attribute to indicate it's decorative (role="presentation" or role="none").
