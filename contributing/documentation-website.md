# Documentation website

We have a new documentation website under `design-system-docs`.

## Setup

See the [design-system-docs README for instructions on how to run the documentation website locally](../design-system-docs/README.md)

## Deploy previews

The docs site is deployed via Netlify which allows us to access previews of work in progress changes. You can request a preview deploy for any pull request by adding the "docs preview" label.

When the preview is ready a comment will be added to your pull request with a link to the preview site.

**Note**: Pull requests from forks will not be able to deploy a preview to Netlify as the workflow will not have access to the required secrets.
