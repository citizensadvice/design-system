# Documentation site

We have a new documentation site under `design-system-docs`.

This docs site is deployed via Netlify which allows us to access previews of work in progress changes. You can request a preview deploy for any pull request by adding the "docs preview" label.

When the preview is ready a comment will be added to your pull request with a link to the preview site.

This should not trigger a preview as the label has been removed.

Note: Pull requests from forks will not be able to deploy a preview to Netlify as the workflow will not have access to the required secrets.
