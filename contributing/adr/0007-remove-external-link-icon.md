# 7. Remove external link icon

Date: 2024-02-13

## Status

Proposed

## Context

We have determined that the external link icon is often confusing and ambiguous for users.

This is for many of the reasons outlined here:

## Decision

We will completely remove the external link icon from the Design System.

## Consequences

- We avoid confusion and ambiguity where the icon is not widely recognised and is often confused to mean opens in a new window
- We often already communicate this with content within the link text e.g. "check if you have a right of abode on GOV.UK"
- We reduce technical complexity within the codebase
