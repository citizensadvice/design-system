Feature: Automated Release Process

This feature is to automate the design system release process, removing repeatable manual developer actions. 

As a maintainer of the design system components
I need to be able to release updates to the design system using an automated process 
So that I can save time and improve the consistency of release artefacts and processes

As a developer using the design system components
I need to know whether a given release is "pre-release" or "stable"
So that I know whether to use it in production-ready code
 
As a maintainer of the design system components
I need to have the option to release design system updates manually
So that I am not reliant on 3rd party services to release updates automatically e.g. Github / Jenkins
 
As a maintainer of the design system components
I need to be able to stop the automated design system release process
So that so that I can prevent a bad release from being published after the process has started
 
As a user of the design system in a Citizens Advice product team
I need to be aware of new design system releases and what has changed since the last release
So that I have an up-to-date understanding of the Citizens Advice design system to apply to my work

As a maintainer of the design system components
I need to be able to specify whether the release is a major, minor or patch release
So that users of the design system know what types of changes are included in the release
