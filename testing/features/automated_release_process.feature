Feature: Automated Release Process

This is to automate the design system removing manual developer actions. 
    
As a design system developer 
I need to be able to specify that a design system release is Alpha or Public
So that users understand that the design system is ready for either the public or develop environments
 
As a design system developer 
I need to have the option to release design system updates manually
So that I am not reliant on 3rd party services to release updates automatically e.g. Github / Jenkins
 
As a design system developer 
I need to be able to stop the automated design system release process
So that so that I can... prevent errors / make manual changes after the process has started
 
As a user of the design system [who?]
I need to be aware of new design system releases and any changes
So that I have an up-to-date understanding of the Citizens Advice design system to apply to my work
