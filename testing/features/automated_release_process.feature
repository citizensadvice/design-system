Feature: Automated Release Process

This feature is to automate the design system release process, removing repeatable manual developer actions. 

As a design system developer
I need to be able to release updates to the design system using an automated process 
So that I can save time and improve the consistency of release artefacts and processes

As a design system developer 
I need to be able to specify that a design system release is "pre-release" or "stable release"
So that users understand that the design system is ready for either the production or development environments
 
As a design system developer 
I need to have the option to release design system updates manually
So that I am not reliant on 3rd party services to release updates automatically e.g. Github / Jenkins
 
As a design system developer 
I need to be able to stop the automated design system release process
So that so that I can prevent errors and make manual changes after the process has started
 
As a user of the design system in a Citizens Advice product team
I need to be aware of new design system releases and what has changed since the last release
So that I have an up-to-date understanding of the Citizens Advice design system to apply to my work
