# Translations

Translations are handled using the [Rails i18n API](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html). To view translated versions of components, select the globe icon in the toolbar and choose between English and Cymraeg.

Rather than including English or Welsh strings in a component's HAML code they are placed in one of the `yml` files located in the `locales` directrory.

For Example `en.yml` may contain:

```yaml
en:
  cads:
    example:
      name: Citizens Advice
    example:
      body: Loren ipsum dolar sit
    search:
      button: Search
```

To use translations inside of a HAML component pass the translation key to the `t` method like so:

```haml
%h1= t('cads.example.name')
%p= t('cads.example.body')
```

As a rule you should always translate the complete sentance rather than individual words or pharses, this allows the translation to capture the full context of the text.

If a translation is missing the last part of the translation key will be included in the rendered webpage as a capitalised string. There's one in the included example template, press the 'Show code' link to see the underlying code.

## Including desing system translations in your app

We export the locales folder which includes both `en.yml` and `cy.yml`. You can include them in your rails app by [following the guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html#configure-the-i18n-module). The files will be located in `node_modules/@citizensadvice/design-system/locales`.

import haml from './_example.html.haml';
