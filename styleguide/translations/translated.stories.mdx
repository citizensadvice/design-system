# Translations

Translations are handled using the [Rails i18n API](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html). To view translated versions of components, select the globe icon in the toolbar and choose between English and Cymraeg.

Rather than including English or Welsh strings in a component's HAML code they are placed in one of the `yml` files located in the `locales` directrory.

For Example `en.yml` may contain:

```yaml
en:
  cads:
    example:
      name: Citizens Advice
      body: Loren ipsum dolar sit
    search:
      button: Search
```

To use translations inside of a HAML component pass the translation key to the `t` method like so:

```haml
%h1= t('cads.example.name')
%p= t('cads.example.body')
```

As a rule you should always translate the complete sentance rather than individual words or pharses, this allows the translation to capture the full context of the text.

If a translation is missing the last part of the translation key will be included in the rendered webpage as a capitalised string. There's one in the included example template, press the 'Show code' link to see the underlying code.

## Including design system translations in your app

We export the locales folder which includes both `en.yml` and `cy.yml`. The files will be located in `node_modules/@citizensadvice/design-system/locales`.

You can include them in your rails app by adding a `config/initializers/locales.rb` file:

```ruby
# frozen_string_literal: true

I18n.available_locales = [:en, :cy]

# Add design-system locales to the load path
I18n.load_path += Dir[
  Rails.root.join("node_modules/@citizensadvice/design-system/locales/*.yml"),
]
```

See the [Rails i18n guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html#configure-the-i18n-module) for more details.

## Testing translations

To support automated testing of translations you may simply add `&locale=<locale>` to the end of a url. This will work with both the main storybook docs and individual component iframes.
