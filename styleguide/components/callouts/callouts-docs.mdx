# Callouts

There are 4 main callout styles in our Design System:

## Info callout

This callout style should be used on important, non-mandatory advice for users that donâ€™t have any serious or legal implications. There might be other implications.

<Preview>
  <Story id="components-callouts--standard" />
</Preview>

## Example callout

This style is when an example needs to be displayed. Also, use it for quotes.

<Preview>
  <Story id="components-callouts--example" />
</Preview>

## Important callout

The important callout should be used for any important snippet of text that has serious and/or legal implications if the user does not follow the advice.

<Preview>
  <Story id="components-callouts--important" />
</Preview>

## Adviser callout

Content that is for advisers. This should not be shown to the public and you should only show this when an adviser is logged in.

<Preview>
  <Story id="components-callouts--adviser" />
</Preview>

## When to use

Callouts can be used to highlight information within content, for example:

- Important information
- Adviser-only information
- Examples
- Quotes

Before using a callout, make sure you really need it. Fewer callouts have more of an impact on a piece of content. Too many callouts can confuse and distract users from other important content on a page.

## Usage

Callouts should come with a title that explains the subject of the information when possible. This will give the users an idea of what the information is about.

### Markup

The title should be used as `h3` no matter where they are on the page. If a callout is the first thing on the page under a `h1`, still put it in the backend as a `h3` and the CMS will make sure it displays correctly.

## Haml template options

The Haml partial takes a `notice` hash with the following properties:

| Property | Description                                                          |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `type`   | Optional type, one of: `standard`, `example`, `important`, `adviser` |
| `body`   | HTML string                                                          |
