# Pagination

Pagination exists as a HTML and CSS only component so you will need to use the "show code" button on each story to view usage.

## Example

<Preview>
  <Story id="components-pagination--example" />
</Preview>

### Accessibility requirements

- Pagination is wrapped in a `<nav>` with `role="navigation"` and an appropriate `aria-label` e.g. `aria-label="Pagination navigation"`. You may wish to customise this based on the context it is used in, e.g. "Search pagination"
- Each link has an appropriate `aria-label` e.g. "Go to first page", or "Go to page 3".
- The current page has an `aria-label` of `aria-label="Current page, page 5"` with `aria-current="page"`

## Paging info
