# Targeted content

The targeted content component allows users to show and hide sections of related content on a page. It can help users scan and process content on a page more effectively. 

However, it does hide content from users and it can be easy for users to miss. When using it, you should aim to use **no more than 6** and you shouldn’t have a targeted content on its own. 

Because targeted contents hide content, they should always have a clear label/title that helps users understand what is in the section.  
You can use `h3` within them to break up the content.

## When to use 

When content is only relevant to some particular users visiting the page.

## When not to use

They shouldn’t be used to make a page seem shorter, for example by using them to hide large chunks of content.  
If you find yourself using targeted content to do this, think about:

- If you’re repeating content on the page and could consolidate it.
- Using headings on the page instead.
- If you need to move some of the content onto another page.

## Default behaviour

<Preview>
  <Story
    name="Default"
    parameters={{ docs: { source: { code: templateDefault.raw } } }}
  >
    {(_, options) => translate(templateDefault, options)}
  </Story>
</Preview>

## Open targeted content with anchor

<Preview>
  <Story
    name="With anchor"
    parameters={{ docs: { source: { code: templateAnchor.raw } } }}
  >
    {(_, options) => translate(templateAnchor, options)}
  </Story>
</Preview>

## Haml template options

The Haml partial takes a `targetContent` hash with the following properties:

| properties               | Description            |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| `targetContent['id']`    | Required, unique ID    |
| `targetContent['title']` | Required, title string |
| `targetContent['body']`  | Required, body HTML    |

For example:

<Source dark="true" language="haml" code={templateDefault.raw} />

## JavaScript behaviour

Targeted content requires some additional JavaScript behaviour which can be initialised with:

```js
import initTargetedContent from '@citizensadvice/design-system/lib/targeted-content';
initTargetedContent();
```

**Note**: If you are supporting IE 11 or earlier make sure you include an [Element.prototype.closest polyfill](https://www.npmjs.com/package/element-closest).
