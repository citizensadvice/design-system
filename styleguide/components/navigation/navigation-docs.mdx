# Navigation

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-navigation--default" />
</Canvas>

The global navigation uses the 'Priority+' pattern to allow as many links to be visible as possible.
As the width of the viewport is restricted, navigation links fall into a collapsible 'More' section.

On mobile devices, any links that appear in the `.js-cads-copy-into-nav` element in the header are copied into the collapsible more section too.

## Using with Rails

If you are using the `citizens_advice_components` gem, you can call the component from within a template using:

```rb
render CitizensAdviceComponents::Navigation.new(
  links: [
    { url: "/benefits/", title: "Benefits" },
    { url: "/work/", title: "Work" },
    { url: "/debt-and-money/", title: "Debt and money" },
    { url: "/consumer/", title: "Consumer" },
    { url: "/housing/", title: "Housing" },
    { url: "/family/", title: "Family" },
    { url: "/law-and-courts/", title: "Law and courts" },
    { url: "/immigration/", title: "Immigration" },
    { url: "/health/", title: "Health" },
    { url: "/more", title: "More from us" }
  ]
)
```
