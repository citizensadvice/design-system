## Using with Rails

If you are using the `citizens_advice_components` gem, you can call the component from within a template using:

```rb
= render CitizensAdviceComponents::Sidebar.new(title: "Related Content") do |c|
    c.section_title(title: "Applying to the EU settlement scheme", url: "/immigration#h-applying-to-the-eu-settlement-scheme")
    c.sidebar_links([
      { title: "Preparing to apply for pre-settled and settled status", url: "/immigration/preparing-to-apply-for-pre-settled-and-settled-status" },
      { title: "Applying for pre-settled and settled status", url: "/immigration/applying-for-settled-status" },
      { title: "Updating and proving your pre-settled or settled status", url: "/immigration/viewing-your-pre-settled-or-settled-status" },
      { title: "Switching from pre-settled to settled status", url: "/immigration/switching-from-pre-settled-to-settled-status" },
      { title: "Problems with your settled status decision", url: "/immigration/problems-with-your-settled-status-decision" }
    ])
    "Additional content"
end
```
