## Using with Rails

If you are using the `citizens_advice_components` gem, you can call the component from within a template following the example below.

Note the options for the haml template and view component are the same.

```rb
= render(
  CitizensAdviceComponents::Table.new(
    header:  [
      "Your location",
      "Post box collection times"
    ],
    rows: [
      [
        "City or town",
        "9am to 6.30pm"
      ],
      [
        "Areas with lots of businesses - known as commercial",
        "9am to 7.30pm"
      ],
      [
        "Very rural areas - for example, where there aren't many people",
        "9am to 4pm"
      ],
      [
        "Rest of the UK",
        "9am to 5.30pm"
      ]
    ],
    caption: "My great table about stuff"
  )
)
```

## Haml template and View component options

The Haml partial takes a `table_data` hash with the properties in the table below. If you are using the view component, these are passed into the `.new()` method as parameters:

| Property   | Description                                     |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `caption`  | Optional, table caption                         |
| `header[]` | Required, an array of header titles             |
| `rows[]`   | Required, array of tuples containing row values |
