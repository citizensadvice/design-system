## Using with Rails

If you are using the `citizens_advice_components` gem, you can call the component from within a template following the example below.

```rb
= render(
  CitizensAdviceComponents::Table.new(
    header:  [
      "Your location",
      "Post box collection times"
    ],
    rows: [
      [
        "City or town",
        "9am to 6.30pm"
      ],
      [
        "Areas with lots of businesses - known as commercial",
        "9am to 7.30pm"
      ],
      [
        "Very rural areas - for example, where there aren't many people",
        "9am to 4pm"
      ],
      [
        "Rest of the UK",
        "9am to 5.30pm"
      ]
    ],
    caption: "My great table about stuff"
  )
)
```
