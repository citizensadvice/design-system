# Disclosure

The disclosure component allows users to reveal more information or extra functionality only if they need it.

## When to use

To hide functionality that most users will not use.

## When not to use

The disclosure component should not be used just to declutter an interface.
If you have functionality that a lot of users will need, the options should not be hidden as a lot of users will miss it. (For example the 'This advice applies to' switcher at the top of advice pages now lists all nations as most users missed the drop-down that was there before.)

## Default behaviour

<Preview>
  <Story id="components-disclosure--example" />
</Preview>

## Without open summary text behaviour

<Preview>
  <Story id="components-disclosure--without-open-summary" />
</Preview>

## With custom id

By default, the `data-toggle-target-id` (used in JavaScript), is generated based on the closed label. Adding a custom id is useful in the cases where there are more than one disclosure per page and it is possible that multiple disclosures would have the same label

<Preview>
  <Story id="components-disclosure--with-custom-id" />
</Preview>

## With additional attributes

It is possible to add additional attributes such as custom `data` attributes

<Preview>
  <Story id="components-disclosure--with-additional-attributes" />
</Preview>

## Fallback behaviour

If JavaScript either fails or is disabled in the users browser the fallback is to show the content as open.

<Preview>
  <Story id="components-disclosure--fallback" />
</Preview>

## JavaScript behaviour

Targeted content requires some additional JavaScript behaviour which can be initialised with:

```js
import initDisclosure from '@citizensadvice/design-system/lib/disclosure';
initDisclosure();
```

## Using with Rails

If you are using the `citizens_advice_components` gem you call the component from within a template using:

```rb
= render(CitizensAdviceComponents::Disclosure.new(closed_summary: "Show content", open_summary: "Hide content")) do
  %p Your HTML content
```

### Component arguments
