# Disclosure

The targeted content component allows users to show and hide sections of related content on a page. It can help users scan and process content on a page more effectively.

However, it does hide content from users and it can be easy for users to miss. When using it, you should aim to use **no more than 6** and you shouldn’t have a targeted content on its own.

Because targeted contents hide content, they should always have a clear label/title that helps users understand what is in the section. You can use `h3` within them to break up the content.

## When to use

When content is only relevant to some particular users visiting the page.

## When not to use

They shouldn’t be used to make a page seem shorter, for example: using them to hide large chunks of content.
If you find yourself using targeted content to do this, think about:

- If you’re repeating content on the page and could consolidate it.
- Using headings on the page instead.
- If you need to move some of the content onto another page.

## Default behaviour

<Preview>
  <Story id="components-disclosure--example" />
</Preview>

## Without open summary text behaviour

<Preview>
  <Story id="components-disclosure--without-open-summary" />
</Preview>

## Fallback behaviour

If JavaScript either fails or is disabled in the users browser the fallback is to show the content as open.

<Preview>
  <Story id="components-disclosure--fallback" />
</Preview>

## JavaScript behaviour

Targeted content requires some additional JavaScript behaviour which can be initialised with:

```js
import initDisclosure from '@citizensadvice/design-system/lib/disclosure';
initDisclosure();
```

## Using with Rails

If you are using the `citizens_advice_components` gem you call the component from within a template using:

```rb
= render(CitizensAdviceComponents::TargetedContent.new(title: "Your title",
  id: "targeted-content-example-id")) do
  %p Your HTML content
```
