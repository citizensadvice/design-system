# Contact Details

Contact details - such as an address. Paragraphs inside of `.contact-details` have their vertical margins removed to allow for information to appear visually grouped.

The business name should be marked up as bold (`b`).

## Using with Rails

If you are using the `citizens_advice_components` gem, you can call the component from within a template following the example below.

```rb
= render(CitizensAdviceComponents::ContactDetails.new) do
  %p
    %b Example organisation
  %p Telephone: 0300 555 5555
  %p Monday to Friday, 8am to 5pm
  %p Saturday, 8am to 4pm
  %p
    %a{ href: 'http://example.com' } Link to the website
```

The component accepts a single `content` block as shown above.
