# SVG Icons

If you are designing SVG icons, please refer to [Foundations - Icon](?path=/docs/foundations-icon--page).

## Using with Rails

SVG icons are now available as Rails view components. You can call them from within a template using:

```rb
render CitizensAdviceComponents::Icons::Email.new(size: :small)
```

You can look in the 'Component class' column of the [examples table](?path=/story/components-svg-icons--default) to see which component class to use for which icon.

### View Component Options

The constructor accepts the following arguments

| Property | Description                                                                             |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `size`   | Defaults to `:small`. One of either `:small` (16px by 16px) or `:large` (24px by 24px). |

## Using as inline files

The SVG code is available for you in `/assets/svg/icons`, or via inspection of the [examples table](?path=/story/components-svg-icons--default).

## Customising icon appearance

Each `<svg>` element is rendered with the following classes:

- `.cads-icon`
- `.cads-icon--{size}` (where {size} is `large` or `small`)
- `.cads-icon--{name}` (where {name} is the dasherised version of the component class name)

The default `fill` colour is `currentColor`. You can override this in your CSS using the class mentioned above, eg:

```CSS
.my-component .cads-icon--arrow-up {
  fill: #0000ff;
}
```

## Combined Icons

In some instances, you might need to combine icons into one SVG and use javascript and CSS to create a toggleable combined icon. You can do this by:

- combining the relevant `path` elements into the same `svg` element
- adding classes to the `path` elements
- add supporting CSS and JS to show/hide the required `path` elements

For convenience, two common examples of this are included in the design system: the PlusMinus icon and the ArrowUpDown icon.

They can be used in the same way as the other icon components:

```
  = render CitizensAdviceComponents::Icons::PlusMinus.new(size: :large)
  = render CitizensAdviceComponents::Icons::ArrowUpDown.new(size: :large)
```

The supporting CSS for these components has been written. Append `.show-up` to show to the up arrow in `ArrowUpDown` and `.show-minus` to show the minus in `PlusMinus`.

You will need to write your own javascript that toggles the required class, eg:

```
var button = document.querySelector('button');

button.addEventListener('click', function() {
  const icon = document.querySelector('.cads-icon');
  icon.classList.toggle('show-minus')
});
```
