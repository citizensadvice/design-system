# Future version roadmap

Here is what will be happening with the design system over the next few versions.

## v4.2.0+

- all existing components will also be available as [view components](https://viewcomponent.org/)
- no additional functionality will be added to haml partials
- only modification to haml partials will be bugfixes and any WCAG 2.X A or AA enhancements

We are currently investigating ways of surfacing deprecation warnings for these haml partials.

## v5.0.0+

- haml partials will be removed from the design system
- consumers of the design system must use the view components or the HTML and CSS examples provided
- ongoing work to improve SASS documentation

## Documentation

Currently the desgin system is documented using storybook. Work to replace this with a more suitable site constructed using the design system itself is ongoing.

If you use the design system, we would really value your input on what should be in the documentation and how it should be presented. You can contribute to our [Mural board capturing user requirements](https://app.mural.co/t/calab5075/m/calab5075/1626882797768/17426c88a0e19b9bca34ca722f9b73372f10b300).
