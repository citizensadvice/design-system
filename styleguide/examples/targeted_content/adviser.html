      Students and people who can support themselves without working
      (either with their own money, or with help from family or friends)
      can have a right to reside.
    </p>
    <p>
      One condition of this type of right to reside is that they won’t
      be an ‘unreasonable burden on the social assistance system’ - either
      they’re unlikely to claim benefits or, if they do, they won’t need them for long.
