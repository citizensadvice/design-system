# Typography

Our typeface is Open Sans, it's modern, easy to read and available to download for free. We use font weight bold (700) and normal (400) on our websites.

## Body

export const paragraphTextHtml = `<div class="cads-prose"><p>The default paragraph font size is 18px on large screens and 16px on small screens.</p></div>`;

<Preview>
  <Story
    name="Paragraph"
    parameters={{ docs: { source: { code: paragraphTextHtml } } }}
  >
    {() => paragraphTextHtml}
  </Story>
</Preview>

Use small text for metadata and some UI components. The majority of your body copy should use the standard 18px font size.

export const paragraphSmallHtml = `<div class="cads-prose"><p class="cads-paragraph-small">Small paragraph font size is 16px on large screens and 14px on smaller screens.</p></div>`;

<Preview>
  <Story
    name="Small paragraph"
    parameters={{ docs: { source: { code: paragraphSmallHtml } } }}
  >
    {() => paragraphSmallHtml}
  </Story>
</Preview>

## Headings

Make sure to use the appropriate <h#> level, and don't skip heading levels.

H4s are available for custom designed components or pages. Do not use for advice content. If using an H4 in your designs, make sure to use correct heading levels.

export const headingsHtml = `<div class="cads-prose"><h1>Heading level 1</h1><h2>Heading level 2</h2><h3>Heading level 3</h3><h4>Heading level 4</h4></div>`;

<Preview>
  <Story
    name="Headings"
    parameters={{ docs: { source: { code: headingsHtml } } }}
  >
    {() => headingsHtml}
  </Story>
</Preview>

## Links

Links are blue and underlined by default. Avoid opening links in a new tab, as it can confuse some users.

export const linkTextHtml = `<div class="cads-prose"><p><a href="">cads-hyperlink</a></p></div>`;

<Preview>
  <Story name="Links" parameters={{ docs: { source: { code: linkTextHtml } } }}>
    {() => linkTextHtml}
  </Story>
</Preview>

Read our guidance about using <a href ="?path=/docs/components-buttons--primary">buttons as links</a>.

## Technical implementation

Typography styles have been created using placeholders and extended into the relevant classes for components that consume them.

### Scoped Styles

Where is it not possible to add classes to typography elements, for example where the content comes from a CMS or some such WYSIWYG editor, they should be encolsed in a `.cads-prose` element.

```html
<main class="cads-prose">
  <h1>Your options if you're in the UK illegally</h1>
  <h2>Get immigration advice</h2>
  <p>
    There are ways to make your stay legal. An immigration specialist will
    decide which applies to you. Don't worry, getting advice will be
    confidential - they won't tell anybody about your query. Contact your
    nearest Citizens Advice for help finding an adviser in your area.
  </p>
</main>
```

### Adjacent Header Mixin

To ensure that headers have the correct margins applied inside the `.cads-prose` element, a mixin has been used that will add the correct margin.

```scss
@include cads-adjacent-heading-margin($margin);
```

To ensure the appropriate margin between the `<p>` and the `<div>`, use the mixin above:

```scss
.references-has-button {
    @include cads-adjacent-heading-margin($cads-spacing-6);
    ...
}
```

### Using typography for new components

If you are creating components that will live inside a `.cads-prose` element and that will enclose an `h2` or `h3` element, you will need to add the mixin to the class that is enclosing the header.

For example, you have created a `.references-has-button` div that wraps a header and a button, which is itself inside the `.cads-prose` element:

```html
<main class="cads-prose">
  <h2>Some heading</h2>
  <p>Some content</p>
  <div class="references-has-button">
    <h2>My reference heading</h2>
    <button>Add reference</button>
  </div>
</main>
```

When building new components, avoid using line height for spacing and alignment. Use the typographic scale that is established.
