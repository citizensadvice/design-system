# Typography

Typography styles have been created using placeholders and extended into the relevant classes for components that consume them.

## Scoped Styles

Where is it not possible to add classes to typography elements, for example where the content comes from a CMS or some such WYSIWYG editor, they should be encolsed in a `.cads-prose` element.

```html
<main class="cads-prose">
  <h1>Your options if you're in the UK illegally</h1>
  <h2>Get immigration advice</h2>
  <p>
    There are ways to make your stay legal. An immigration specialist will
    decide which applies to you. Don't worry, getting advice will be
    confidential - they won't tell anybody about your query. Contact your
    nearest Citizens Advice for help finding an adviser in your area.
  </p>
</main>
```

## Adjacent Header Mixin

To ensure that headers have the correct margins applied inside the `.cads-prose` element, a mixin has been used that will add the correct margin.

```scss
@include cads-adjacent-heading-margin($margin);
```

If you are creating components that will live inside a `.cads-prose` element and that will enclose an `h2` or `h3` element, you will need to add the mixin to the class that is enclosing the header.

For example, you have created a `.references-has-button` div that wraps a header and a button, which is itself inside the `.cads-prose` element:

```html
<main class="cads-prose">
  <h2>Some heading</h2>
  <p>Some content</p>
  <div class="references-has-button">
    <h2>My reference heading</h2>
    <button>Add reference</button>
  </div>
</main>
```

To ensure the appropriate margin between the `<p>` and the `<div>`, use the mixin above:

```scss
.references-has-button {
    @include cads-adjacent-heading-margin($cads-spacing-6);
    ...
}
```
