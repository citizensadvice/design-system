# Grid

## Basic grids

Grids are made up of three parts:

- A `.cads-grid-container` wrapper element
- One or more `.cads-grid-row` elements to demarcate a grid rows
- A combination of `.cads-grid-col-*` classes to demarcate grid columns

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Basic grid"
    parameters={{
      layout: 'fullscreen',
      docs: { source: { code: templateBasic.raw } },
    }}
  >
    {() => templateBasic}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Multi-column grids

Grids are **12** columns by default (although this can be configured by overriding the `$cads-grid-columns` variable). You can combine a number of column sizes within a grid row.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Multi-column grid"
    parameters={{
      layout: 'fullscreen',
      docs: { source: { code: templateMultiColumn.raw } },
    }}
  >
    {() => templateMultiColumn}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Responsive grids

If you want different grid columns at different breakpoints you can use `sm`, `md`, and `lg` variants of the `.cads-grid-col` classes to control this.

The following example has a column which 10 columns at large breakpoints, 8 at medium breakpoints, and full-width at small breakpoints.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Responsive grid columns"
    parameters={{
      layout: 'fullscreen',
      docs: { source: { code: templateResponsive.raw } },
    }}
  >
    {() => templateResponsive}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
