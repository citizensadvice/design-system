# Icons

Icons should be informative and recognisable. They should only be used in a purposeful manner to maximise comprehension when you need to call attention to a particular action. 
Icons should be used in combination with a meaningful label or supporting text whenever possible. Avoid `aria-labels` if you are rendering the icon with visible text to prevent accessibility label duplication.

## Colour

Icons should always be in a single, solid colour and need to meet the same colour contrast ratio as Typography (4.5:1). The colour of the icon should reflect the importance of the icon’s action which should always be to help guide a user. For more information on colour, see the [Colour guidelines](/design-system/?path=/story/foundations-colours--page) . 

## Sizing

There are 2 icon sizes in our Design system:

### 16px (small)

We use small icons in our components such as "Chevron" in the buttons or a "Plus" in the targeted content. We also use an "External link" in the content whenever it’s needed.

### 24px (medium)

Medium icons are generally used as a button such as the "Search" button and the "Print this page" button in the toolbar on the Public site and AdviserNet.
Do not attempt to re-size the icon, as they are designed specifically for a certain size. Only use these 2 icon sizes to ensure the consistency throughout our designs.

## Alignment

When an icon is right next to the text, they should be centre-aligned and have 4px spacing in-between.

### Considerations before creating a new icon

Before trying to create a new icon, consider if:
- The new icon serves a need(s). If in doubt, you probably don’t need it
- The new icon would be used multiple times throughout the products
- The new icon has a clear meaning

Propose the new icons to the design community and discuss details and requirements. This will help us to have a transparent process for creating new assets, maintaining a minimal and high quality icon set in our Design system. 

### Making an icon

In order to have the best clarity especially for lower resolution screens, make sure the icon is always pixel-perfect.

Use the guideline artboards in the [Design system 2.0 Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/J9qfbS9n1pUM2dpRQnTXUD/?node-id=716%3A0) and follow the rules below:

- Use the 16px x 16px or 24px x 24px artboard for each icon.
- The 16px icon should have 1px padding and the 24px icon should have 2px padding.
- Set your workspace up from the start to snap to pixels without decimals.
- Icons should be at whole pixels. No decimals are allowed in x and y coordinates or width and height fields.
- Each artboard and the artwork within it must be aligned to the pixel grid. 
- The icon should be on the top of the boundary box layer in the artboard. 
- All possible shapes and paths should be combined. This will allow us to have a good SVG setup when extracting icons.

Speak to the design community if you have any questions about the rules.
