# Text visibility

There are a number of ways to show/hide text visually and in the context of a screen reader. Use the inspect tools to see what the gap below is.

<p class="cads-hide">completely hidden text</p>
<p class="cads-invisible">mostly hidden text</p>
<p class="cads-sr-show">Only seen by screen readers</p>
<p aria-hidden="true">
  This text can be seen, but won't be read by a screen reader.
</p>

```html
<p class="cads-hide">completely hidden text</p>
<p class="cads-invisible">
  hidden text but takes up the same space if the text was visible
</p>

<p class="cads-sr-show">Only seen by screen readers</p>
<p aria-hidden="true">
  This text can be seen, but won't be read by a screen reader.
</p>
```
