# Breakpoints

There are 3 breakpoints defined.

- `sm`: up to 767px
- `md`: between 768 and 1023px
- `lg`: up from 1024px

To see how any tokens or components respond to different screen sizes just resize this window and look out for the breakpoint indicator.

## SASS mixins

### Media breakpoint up

Targeting screen sizes from minimum breakpoint width

```scss
@include cads-media-breakpoint-up(sm) { ... }
@include cads-media-breakpoint-up(md) { ... }
@include cads-media-breakpoint-up(lg) { ... }

// Example usage:
@include cads-media-breakpoint-up(sm) {
  .some-class {
    display: block;
  }
}
```

### Media breakpoint down

Targeting screen sizes up to maximum breakpoint width

```scss
@include cads-media-breakpoint-down(sm) { ... }
@include cads-media-breakpoint-down(md) { ... }
@include cads-media-breakpoint-down(lg) { ... }

// Example usage:
@include cads-media-breakpoint-down(lg) {
  .some-class {
    display: block;
  }
}
```

### Media breakpoint only

Targeting a single segment of screen sizes using the minimum and maximum breakpoint widths

```
@include cads-media-breakpoint-only(sm) { ... }
@include cads-media-breakpoint-only(md) { ... }
@include cads-media-breakpoint-only(lg) { ... }

// Example usage:
@include cads-media-breakpoint-only(md) {
  .some-class {
    display: block;
  }
}
```

### Media breakpoint between

Targeting screen sizes between multiple breakpoint widths

```
@include cads-media-breakpoint-between(sm, lg) { ... }
@include cads-media-breakpoint-between(md, lg) { ... }

// Example usage:
@include cads-media-breakpoint-between(md, lg) { ... }
  .some-class {
    display: block;
  }
}
```
