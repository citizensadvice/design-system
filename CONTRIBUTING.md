# Contributing

The following guides are to help you in contributing to the design system codebase and are best read in order:

1. [Architecture overview](./contributing/01-architecture.md)
2. [Local setup](./contributing/02-local-setup.md)
3. [Testing](./contributing/03-testing.md)
4. [Release process](./contributing/04-release-process.md)
5. [Maintenance policy](./contributing/05-maintenance-process.md)

## Architecture decision records

We use architecture decision records (ADRs) to document code-level architectural decisions that we make. These are stored in [`contributing/adr`](./contributing/adr/README.md).
