## Styleguide

The styleguide is automatically hosted in [Github pages](https://citizensadvice.github.io/design-system-testing/), based on the content of the `docs` folder.

To build and run the styleguide in dev mode locally:

```
npm run styleguide
```

The styleguide runs on http://localhost:6006. The documentation is generated using storybook and the code lives under `styleguide`.

The static version of the styleguide is build into `docs` using `npm run docs:build`, which then gets automatically hosted into Github pages. You can serve the generated files from `docs` by running `npm run docs:serve`.

Currently there is no automated process to rebuild the contents of the `docs` folder, so you need to remember to do that whenever you make a release (currently that is merging into `master`).

### ITCSS

What are the different layers?

1. Settings – used with preprocessors and contain font, colors definitions, etc.
2. Tools – globally used mixins and functions. It’s important not to output any CSS in the first 2 layers.
3. Generic – reset and/or normalize styles, box-sizing definition, etc. This is the first layer which generates actual CSS.
4. Elements – styling for bare HTML elements (like H1, A, etc.). These come with default styling from the browser so we can redefine them here.
5. Objects – class-based selectors which define undecorated design patterns, for example media object known from OOCSS
6. Components – specific UI components. This is where the majority of our work takes place and our UI components are often composed of Objects and Components
7. Utilities – utilities and helper classes with ability to override anything which goes before in the triangle, eg. hide helper class
